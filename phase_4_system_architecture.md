# CoinPoker Real-Time Analysis Tool – System Architecture

## 1. Problem Definition

Poker players on CoinPoker require real-time, context-aware decision support without risking detection or violating platform integrity. The system must analyze live game state from screenshots, generate LLM-powered recommendations, and display them in a secure, non-intrusive overlay—all with sub-200ms latency and robust anti-detection.

## 2. Goals

- **Modularity:** Each component/service has a single, well-defined responsibility and interface.
- **Performance:** End-to-end latency (capture to recommendation) under 200ms in 95% of cycles.
- **Security:** No direct CoinPoker API/memory access; process isolation; anti-detection strategies.
- **Testability:** All modules are unit/integration testable; clear contracts and event flows.
- **Maintainability:** Well-documented, extensible, and easy to update.
- **Scalability:** Design supports future platforms and distributed deployment.
- **Observability:** Monitoring, logging, and telemetry for all critical paths.

## 3. Constraints

- **Local-Only:** All game data processing must occur on the user’s machine.
- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Credentials managed via environment/config, never in code.
- **Legal/Ethical:** Must inform users of potential ToS risks; comply with local laws.
- **Latency Budget:** 200ms total, including all processing and UI update.
- **No CoinPoker API/Memory Access:** Only passive screenshot analysis and overlay.

## 4. Assumptions

- Users have permission for screen capture and overlay.
- LLM APIs (Gemini Pro, GPT-4) are available and performant.
- CoinPoker UI is visually stable within supported resolutions.
- Users will configure API keys and overlay preferences at setup.

## 5. Solution Overview

### 5.1. Architectural Pattern

- **Event-Driven Modular Monolith:** Electron/Node.js app with clear service boundaries, event bus, and optional MCP server for orchestration.
- **C4 Model:** Context, container, and component views provided.

### 5.2. Core Modules/Services

### 5.4. Data Flow & Event-Driven Architecture

**Sequence:**
1. `ScreenCaptureModule` triggers on timer or event.
2. Image sent to `DataExtractionModule` (OCR, layout).
3. Structured data passed to `GameStateManager` (diff, validate).
4. On significant change, `DecisionEngine` queries LLM API (with caching).
5. `Recommendation` sent to `OverlayUIModule` for display.
6. `SecurityManager` monitors and adjusts behavior throughout.
7. All modules emit events to MCP for logging, monitoring, and tool orchestration.

**Key Data Contracts (Interface Examples):**
- `ScreenCapture`: `{ captureId, timestamp, resolution, rawData }`
- `GameState`: `{ gameId, timestamp, playerHand, communityCards, potSize, playerChips, opponentActions, currentPhase }`
- `Recommendation`: `{ recommendationId, gameStateId, action, confidence, rationale, timestamp }`
- `OverlayConfig`: `{ position, transparency, visibleElements, fontSize }`
- `SecurityProfile`: `{ profileId, detectionAvoidanceStrategies, lastUpdated }`

### 5.5. Security & Performance Architecture

- **Process Isolation:** Electron renderer (UI) and Node.js backend run in separate processes; sensitive logic in backend only.
- **Anti-Detection:** No direct CoinPoker API/memory access; randomized timing, minimal resource footprint, encrypted LLM comms.
- **Credential Management:** All secrets via environment variables or secure OS store; never hard-coded.
- **Parallel Processing:** Screen capture, OCR, and LLM calls run in parallel where possible; event queue for backpressure.
- **Caching:** LRU cache for LLM responses; fallback to last known good recommendation on API timeout.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus metrics, structured logs, error events to MCP.

### 5.6. MCP Integration Points

- **Game State Resource:** `/game-state` (GET/POST) for current and historical state.
- **Recommendation Tool:** `/recommend` (POST) for LLM queries.
- **Event Stream:** WebSocket `/events` for real-time updates.
- **Admin/Config:** `/config` (GET/POST) for overlay and security settings.

### 5.7. Deployment & Configuration

- **Local App:** Single Electron app bundle; Node.js backend, all modules as services.
- **Config:** `config.json` or environment variables for API keys, overlay defaults, security profiles.
- **Startup:** All modules initialized by main process; MCP server started as subprocess or thread.
- **Monitoring:** Optional Prometheus exporter, log file rotation.

## 6. Milestones

1. **Architecture Finalization**: Review and approve system design.
2. **Core Module Implementation**: Build and test each service boundary.
3. **MCP Server Integration**: Implement and test REST/WebSocket endpoints.
4. **Security & Performance Hardening**: Validate anti-detection, optimize latency.
5. **UI/UX Finalization**: Overlay customization, user settings.
6. **System Integration & E2E Testing**: Full pipeline, edge cases, performance.
7. **Deployment & Monitoring**: Package, distribute, and monitor in production.

## 7. Risk Analysis

- **Detection by CoinPoker**: Mitigated by passive capture, overlay, randomized timing.
- **Latency Overruns**: Parallelization, caching, fallback logic.
- **OCR/LLM Failures**: Error handling, user notification, fallback to cached data.
- **Security Breaches**: No sensitive data stored, encrypted comms, process isolation.

## 8. Success Criteria

- <200ms end-to-end latency in 95% of cycles.
- No CoinPoker detection in extended sessions.
- Accurate recommendations in >95% of test cases.
- Overlay is customizable and non-intrusive.
