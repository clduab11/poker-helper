# CoinPoker Real-Time Analysis Tool - Requirements Specification

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Develop a real-time analysis tool for CoinPoker that provides decision support for poker players through screenshot analysis and LLM-powered recommendations.

**Target Users**: Poker players using CoinPoker platform seeking strategic assistance.

**Scope**: The tool will capture game data via screenshots, analyze it, provide recommendations using an LLM API, and display results via a non-intrusive UI overlay, all while maintaining security against detection.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Integration: Real-Time Data Capture
- **Requirement 1.1**: Capture game state data from CoinPoker through screenshot analysis.
- **Requirement 1.2**: Support multiple screen resolutions and layouts for accurate data extraction.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Successfully extract game data (cards, chips, player actions) from screenshots in under 100ms.
  - Handle at least 3 common resolutions (e.g., 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 1366x768) without data loss.
- **Priority**: Must-have

### 2. Decision Support: LLM-Powered Recommendations
- **Requirement 2.1**: Provide real-time recommendations (bet/raise/call/fold) using Gemini Pro or GPT-4 Turbo API.
- **Requirement 2.2**: Incorporate game context (player hands, community cards, betting history) into recommendations.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Deliver actionable recommendation within 200ms of game state update.
  - Recommendations must be based on current game context and historical data.
- **Priority**: Must-have

### 3. Performance: Low Latency
- **Requirement 3.1**: Ensure end-to-end latency of less than 200ms per decision cycle.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Measure latency from screenshot capture to recommendation display; must be under 200ms in 95% of cycles.
- **Priority**: Must-have

### 4. UI: Non-Intrusive Overlay
- **Requirement 4.1**: Display recommendations via a customizable, non-intrusive overlay on the CoinPoker window.
- **Requirement 4.2**: Allow users to adjust overlay position, transparency, and content visibility.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Overlay must not obstruct critical game elements (cards, buttons).
  - Users can customize at least 3 aspects (position, transparency, content) through a settings interface.
- **Priority**: Must-have

### 5. Security: Anti-Detection Measures
- **Requirement 5.1**: Implement measures to evade CoinPoker security detection mechanisms.
- **Requirement 5.2**: Avoid direct interaction with CoinPoker client (e.g., no API calls or memory reading).
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Tool must operate solely through screenshot analysis and overlay display without triggering CoinPoker security flags.
  - No detectable patterns in system resource usage or input simulation.
- **Priority**: Must-have

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: System must handle continuous operation for sessions up to 8 hours without degradation.
- **Security**: No storage of sensitive game data beyond a single session; use encrypted communication for LLM API calls.
- **Scalability**: Design to potentially support additional poker platforms with minimal changes.
- **Usability**: Intuitive setup and minimal user interaction required during gameplay.

## Edge Cases
- **Edge Case 1**: Screenshot analysis fails due to unexpected UI changes in CoinPoker.
- **Edge Case 2**: LLM API latency exceeds 100ms, risking overall latency target.
- **Edge Case 3**: User switches screen resolution mid-session.
- **Edge Case 4**: CoinPoker security updates detect overlay or screenshot activity.
- **Edge Case 5**: Multiple CoinPoker windows open simultaneously.

## Constraints
- **Technical**: Must operate on userâ€™s local machine without server-side components for game data processing.
- **Performance**: Total latency budget of 200ms includes screenshot capture, analysis, LLM processing, and UI update.
- **Legal/Ethical**: Must comply with local regulations regarding online gaming assistance tools; inform users of potential terms of service violations with CoinPoker.
- **Security**: No hard-coded API keys or secrets; use configuration placeholders.

## Dependencies
- **External**: LLM API service (Gemini Pro or GPT-4 Turbo) for decision logic.
- **Internal**: Modular design to separate data capture, analysis, decision-making, and UI components.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk 1**: CoinPoker detects tool usage, leading to account bans.
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on passive data capture (screenshots) and overlay display; implement randomized timing in actions if needed.
- **Risk 2**: Latency exceeds 200ms under high system load.
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize image processing algorithms; provide fallback recommendations based on cached data.
- **Risk 3**: Inaccurate data extraction from screenshots.
  - **Mitigation**: Use robust OCR and image recognition with error checking; allow user correction of misreads.

## Business Rules
- Recommendations must be advisory; final decision remains with the user.
- Tool must log session data locally (anonymized) for performance analysis, with user consent.

## Glossary
- **Game State**: Current snapshot of poker game including player hands, community cards, pot size, and player actions.
- **Decision Cycle**: Process from data capture to recommendation display.
- **Overlay**: UI element displaying recommendations over the CoinPoker window.
